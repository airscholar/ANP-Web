Requiring no set-up, the technology is relied on by over 3,500 organizations to protect their entire digital enterprise, including the cloud, virtualized environments, SaaS applications, and industrial control systems.</p><div class="side-quote no-animation"><div class="quote">
“Darktrace is one of the few cases where talk about use of AI in cyber security has turned into<span style="white-space: nowrap;"> action.”</span></div><div class="attribution">Ovum</div></div><h2>The Enterprise Immune System</h2><p>The Enterprise Immune System is a self-learning cyber AI technology that detects novel attacks and insider threats at an early stage — without relying on rules, signatures, or prior assumptions.</p><p>Modeled on the human immune system, the technology learns and understands ‘self’ for everyone and everything in the business, and can spot the subtle signals of an advanced attack, whether that emerges in the network or in cloud environments and SaaS applications.</p><h2>The Industrial Immune System</h2><p>The Industrial Immune System is a fundamental AI technology for OT cyber defense. It works by passively learning what ‘normal’ looks like across OT, IT and industrial IoT, allowing it to detect even the subtlest signals of emerging cyber-threats in real time, in both OT environments, such as SCADA systems, and IT networks.</p><h2>Antigena Network</h2><p>Powered by Darktrace’s multi-award-winning AI, Antigena Network is an autonomous response solution that uses Cyber AI to calculate the best action to take, in the shortest period of time, to effectively respond to in-progress cyber-threats, limiting damage and stopping their spread in real time.</p><h2>Antigena Email</h2><p>Antigena Email uses Darktrace’s core artificial intelligence to stop the most advanced email threats, intervening to protect employees from the full range of threats targeting the inbox.</p><p>Rather than relying on static rules and historical data, the technology works by understanding the unique ‘patterns of life’ of email users and the complex web of relationships between them. This self-learning approach allows Antigena Email to reveal seemingly benign emails as unmistakably malicious.</p></div></div></body></html>
